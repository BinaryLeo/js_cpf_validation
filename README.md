Validando CPF - Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas


A CPF number is the Tax ID generated once you have been registered into the Brazilian Revenue.
 CPF stands for "Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas" (Natural Persons Register). 
 The CPF has 11 digits and it may be issued by the Brazilian revenue service in Brazil
  or Brazilian consulates and embassies abroad.

A CPF is required not only to purchase real estate in Brazil,
 but many other things such as paying your taxes, opening a bank account in Brazil, 
  opening a company in Brazil, getting utility services, and being able to enter into general 
  contracts drafted in Brazil.
